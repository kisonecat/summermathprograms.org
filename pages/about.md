# About This Site

Welcome to the **Online Hub** of the **Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium**, a community of programs dedicated to providing mathematically intensive summer enrichment opportunities for middle and high school students.

## Our Mission

The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium was founded to create a shared space for collaboration among the leaders of summer math programs. Our goal is to expand access to deep, meaningful mathematical experiences for young people—especially those who may not otherwise encounter advanced mathematics in school.

We believe that summer math programs change lives. They help students grow as thinkers, build lasting friendships, and discover joy in mathematical exploration.

## What Is This Hub?

This website is a **central resource for students, families, and educators** interested in summer math programs. Whether you're looking for a residential program for high school students, a commuter program for middle schoolers, or something in between, the Hub can help you explore your options and learn more.

Here’s what you’ll find:

- **Program Profiles**: Learn about dozens of summer math programs across the U.S. and beyond. Each profile includes key details like eligibility, format, location, and financial aid.
- **Search and Filter Tools**: Find programs that match your interests using filters such as age range, geographic region, program duration, and more.
- **Blog and News Updates**: Read stories from alumni, learn about upcoming deadlines, and hear what's new in the world of summer math programs.
- **Resources for Families and Educators**: Access guides and tips to help you understand how to support students in pursuing math enrichment.

## A Community Effort

This site is maintained by the Consortium and built with the help of volunteers from member programs. Program information is contributed by program organizers and verified for accuracy. The site is open source, hosted on GitHub, and designed to be transparent and collaborative.

The Online Hub is just one of several Consortium initiatives. Others include:

- An **annual conference** for program leaders to share best practices
- A **Summer Program Incubator** that mentors new math enrichment programs
- Cross-program collaborations on outreach, curriculum, and student support

## Join Us

If you're a student curious about math, a parent looking for meaningful opportunities for your child, or an educator supporting bright minds—you’re in the right place.
