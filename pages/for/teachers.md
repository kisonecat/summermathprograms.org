# For Teachers

As a teacher, you play a powerful role in shaping students' lives—not just during the school year, but in the opportunities they pursue beyond the classroom. The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium is here to help you connect your most curious, motivated students with transformative summer experiences in mathematics.

## What Are Summer Math Programs?

These are **intensive, proof-based enrichment programs** for middle and high school students who enjoy mathematical thinking and problem solving. Programs often introduce topics such as number theory, combinatorics, and abstract algebra—subjects rarely covered in school, but deeply engaging to young thinkers.

They are not acceleration-focused, and they are not remediation. Instead, they offer a chance for students to experience **mathematics as a creative, rigorous, and joyful discipline**.

## Why Recommend a Program?

For many students, a summer math program is the **first time they meet peers who love math as much as they do**. These experiences can:

- Spark a lifelong interest in mathematics and related fields
- Provide mentorship and community
- Build confidence and deepen problem-solving skills
- Prepare students for advanced coursework, college-level thinking, and beyond

You can make the difference by recommending the right student at the right moment.

## What Kind of Students Are a Good Fit?

Great candidates for summer programs often include:

- Students who ask “why” and want to explore patterns and ideas
- Students who enjoy challenging problems and working through frustration
- Students who have shown mathematical creativity, even if they aren't top scorers on timed tests
- Students from underrepresented backgrounds who may not otherwise have access to advanced math experiences

If a student reminds you of someone who would thrive in a math research setting or who loves to puzzle through hard questions, they may be a perfect fit.

## How Can I Help?

You can support your students by:

- **Nominating or encouraging them** to explore programs on this site
- **Writing recommendation letters** (some programs request one)
- **Helping with applications**, especially when math problems are part of the process
- **Reaching out to families** who may be unfamiliar with summer programs
- **Reminding students about deadlines**, which often fall between December and March

You can also share this site with your whole class—sometimes students surprise you!

## Equity and Access

Many Consortium programs offer **robust financial aid**. If you know a student with talent and passion who worries about cost, please encourage them to apply and reach out to programs directly. Cost should never be the barrier.
