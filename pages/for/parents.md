# For Parents

Welcome! If you’re here, it likely means your child has a strong interest in mathematics—or maybe even a passion for it. The Summer Mathematics Programs Consortium exists to help families like yours find meaningful opportunities for mathematical enrichment.

We understand that navigating summer programs—especially for gifted and curious students—can feel overwhelming. This page is here to help.

## What Are Summer Math Programs?

These are **intensive, enrichment-focused programs** that give middle and high school students the opportunity to:

- Explore advanced mathematical topics not typically taught in school
- Solve challenging problems and prove theorems
- Engage with peers who share their intellectual interests
- Learn from instructors who are passionate mathematicians and educators

These programs are not about acceleration or remediation. They are about **exploration, community, and joy in deep thinking**.

---

## Why Might My Child Benefit?

Many parents tell us that a summer math program is the **first time their child felt truly challenged**—and also the first time they felt understood by a community of peers.

Students often return home more confident, more independent, and more excited about mathematics than ever before. These programs can:

- Spark interest in future careers in STEM
- Build problem-solving skills
- Provide mentorship and role models

## What Should I Look for in a Program?

The right fit depends on your child’s age, experience, and personality. Here are some things to consider:

- **Residential or commuter?** Is your child ready to live away from home?
- **Level of mathematical background?** Some programs assume no prior exposure to proofs; others expect experience with contests or Olympiads.
- **Social atmosphere?** Does your child thrive in structured environments, or do they prefer flexible and collaborative settings?
- **Financial aid availability?** Many programs offer generous need-based aid. Don’t let cost be a barrier—read each program’s financial policies carefully.

You can explore all of this using the [Program Search Tool](programs.html).

## Is My Child Ready?

It’s normal to wonder if your child is “ready”—especially for a residential program. Here are some signs they might be:

- They enjoy thinking deeply about challenging problems
- They often ask “why” and want to understand ideas, not just get answers
- They’re excited to meet others who also love math
- They can handle being away from home (with some support and encouragement)

---

## How Can I Support Them?

- Help them identify programs and deadlines early
- Encourage them to apply, but let them take the lead
- Talk through logistics like travel, packing, and homesickness
- After the program, take time to listen—there will be a lot to process!
