experience:
  summary: ÉtaleQuest offers young students the chance to explore the profound beauty of arithmetic geometry through rigorous study of étale cohomology, spectral sequences, and the occasional yoga of sheaves. The program builds community among the next generation of algebraic geometers.
  typical_day: Mornings begin with silent meditation on the étale site, followed by lecture blocks on derived functors and affine schemes; afternoons include problem sets, proof-writing clinics, and sheaf-theoretic arts and crafts.
  struct_vs_flex: Highly structured curriculum centered on SGA excerpts and reinterpretations of EGA IV; optional evening modules on perfectoid spaces and topos theory.
  math_activities:
    - Étale yoga flow sessions
    - Reading seminars (SGA, EGA, and TAG excerpts)
    - Spectral sequence board games
    - Derived category debates
    - Affine open scavenger hunts
  non_math_activities:
    - Grothendieck impersonation contest
    - Braided sheaf bracelet making
    - Cohomology-themed improv
  total_students: 24
  staff_student_ratio: 1:2
  staff_roles_count: 12 staff (3 faculty, 9 grad/postdoc mentors)
  average_class_size: 8
  gender_ratio: Equitably balanced through deep descent
  parent_program: Institute for Highly Abstract Young Mathematicians (IHAYM)
  internal_comments: Alumni have been known to construct their own sites before high school
