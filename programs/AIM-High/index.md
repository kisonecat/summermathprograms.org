experience:
  summary: AIM High challenges students to use mathematics to solve real-world problems in climate modeling, epidemiology, finance, logistics, and more. Students work in project teams guided by faculty and industry professionals, gaining experience in mathematical modeling, coding, and teamwork.
  typical_day: Mornings feature lectures and skill labs (Python, data analysis, modeling techniques); afternoons are devoted to team project work; evenings include industry talks, peer workshops, and career exploration events.
  struct_vs_flex: Students follow a structured track with daily modules but select from a menu of modeling projects and software labs.
  math_activities:
    - Modeling workshops
    - Numerical methods labs
    - Faculty-guided research projects
    - Industry case studies
    - Group presentations
  non_math_activities:
    - Field trip to local tech company or research lab
    - Hackathon night
    - Resume and college essay workshops
